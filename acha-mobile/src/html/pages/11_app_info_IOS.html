                    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>Work and such Derivative Works in Source or

                    <br/>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>this License, each
                    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable<br/>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>use, offer
                    to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>where such license applies only to those
                    patent claims licensable<br/>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>Contribution(s)
                    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
                    submitted. If You<br/>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>cross-claim or
                    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
                    constitutes direct<br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>granted to
                    You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>Work or Derivative Works
                    thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
                    that You<br/>meet the following conditions:
                    <br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>Derivative Works a copy of this
                    License; and
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that You changed
                    the files; and
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>that You distribute, all
                    copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>excluding
                    those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>the Derivative Works; and
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained<br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>pertain to any part
                    of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                    distributed<br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>documentation, if
                    provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and<br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>of the NOTICE
                    file are for informational purposes only and<br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own
                    attribution<br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>or as an addendum
                    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be
                    construed<br/>as modifying the License.
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>may provide additional
                    or different license terms and conditions<br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or<br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>reproduction,
                    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>the conditions stated in this License.
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>any Contribution
                    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of<br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>Notwithstanding
                    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>the terms of any separate license agreement
                    you may have executed<br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>except as required for reasonable and customary
                    use in describing the<br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>agreed to in writing,
                    Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                    BASIS,<br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>implied, including,
                    without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
                    FITNESS FOR A<br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>appropriateness
                    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>whether in tort
                    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly<br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>liable
                    to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>incidental, or consequential
                    damages of any character arising as a<br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to
                    use the<br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>work stoppage,
                    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if
                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.
                    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole
                    responsibility, not on behalf<br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>defend,
                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    patent claims licensable<br/>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>Contribution(s)
                    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was

                    constitutes direct<br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>granted to
                    You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>Work or Derivative Works
                    thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided

                    License; and
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that You changed
                    the files; and
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>that You distribute, all

                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained<br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>pertain to any part
                    of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                    distributed<br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>documentation, if
                    provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and<br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>of the NOTICE
                    file are for informational purposes only and<br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own
                    attribution<br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>or as an addendum
                    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be
                    construed<br/>as modifying the License.
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>may provide additional
                    or different license terms and conditions<br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or<br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>reproduction,
                    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>the conditions stated in this License.
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>any Contribution
                    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of<br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>Notwithstanding
                    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>the terms of any separate license agreement
                    you may have executed<br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>except as required for reasonable and customary
                    use in describing the<br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>agreed to in writing,
                    Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                    BASIS,<br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>implied, including,
                    without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
                    FITNESS FOR A<br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>appropriateness
                    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>whether in tort
                    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly<br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>liable
                    to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>incidental, or consequential
                    damages of any character arising as a<br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to
                    use the<br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>work stoppage,
                    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if
                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.
                    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole
                    responsibility, not on behalf<br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>defend,
                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    constitutes direct<br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>granted to
                    You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>Work or Derivative Works

                    License; and
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that You changed
                    the files; and
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>that You distribute, all
                    copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>excluding
                    those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>the Derivative Works; and
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained<br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>pertain to any part
                    of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                    distributed<br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>documentation, if
                    provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and<br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>of the NOTICE
                    file are for informational purposes only and<br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own
                    attribution<br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>or as an addendum
                    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be
                    construed<br/>as modifying the License.
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>may provide additional
                    or different license terms and conditions<br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or<br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>reproduction,
                    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>the conditions stated in this License.
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>any Contribution
                    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of<br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>Notwithstanding
                    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>the terms of any separate license agreement
                    you may have executed<br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>except as required for reasonable and customary
                    use in describing the<br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>agreed to in writing,
                    Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                    BASIS,<br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>implied, including,

                    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>whether in tort
                    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly<br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>liable
                    to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>incidental, or consequential
                    damages of any character arising as a<br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to
                    use the<br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>work stoppage,
                    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if
                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.

                    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable<br/>copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br/>publicly display,
                    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>Work and such Derivative Works in Source or

                    patent claims licensable<br/>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>Contribution(s)
                    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
                    submitted. If You<br/>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>cross-claim or
                    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
                    constitutes direct<br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>granted to
                    You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>Work or Derivative Works
                    thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
                    that You<br/>meet the following conditions:
                    <br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>Derivative Works a copy of this
                    License; and
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that You changed
                    the files; and
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>that You distribute, all
                    copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>excluding
                    those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>the Derivative Works; and
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained<br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>pertain to any part
                    of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                    distributed<br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>documentation, if
                    provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and<br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>of the NOTICE
                    file are for informational purposes only and<br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own
                    attribution<br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>or as an addendum
                    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be
                    construed<br/>as modifying the License.
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>may provide additional
                    or different license terms and conditions<br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or<br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>reproduction,
                    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>the conditions stated in this License.
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>any Contribution
                    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of<br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>Notwithstanding
                    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>the terms of any separate license agreement
                    you may have executed<br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>except as required for reasonable and customary
                    use in describing the<br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>agreed to in writing,
                    Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                    BASIS,<br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>implied, including,
                    without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
                    FITNESS FOR A<br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>appropriateness
                    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>whether in tort
                    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly<br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>liable
                    to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>incidental, or consequential
                    damages of any character arising as a<br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to
                    use the<br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>work stoppage,
                    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if
                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.
                    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole
                    responsibility, not on behalf<br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>defend,
                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.
                    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole
                    responsibility, not on behalf<br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>defend,
                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>Work and such Derivative Works in Source or

                    <br/>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>this License, each
                    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable<br/>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>use, offer

                    patent claims licensable<br/>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>Contribution(s)
                    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
                    submitted. If You<br/>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>cross-claim or
                    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
                    constitutes direct<br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>granted to
                    You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>Work or Derivative Works
                    thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
                    that You<br/>meet the following conditions:
                    <br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>Derivative Works a copy of this
                    License; and
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that You changed
                    the files; and
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>that You distribute, all
                    copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>excluding
                    those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>the Derivative Works; and
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained<br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>pertain to any part
                    of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                    distributed<br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>documentation, if
                    provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and<br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>of the NOTICE
                    file are for informational purposes only and<br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own
                    attribution<br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>or as an addendum
                    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be
                    construed<br/>as modifying the License.
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>may provide additional
                    or different license terms and conditions<br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or<br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>reproduction,
                    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>the conditions stated in this License.
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>any Contribution
                    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of<br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>Notwithstanding
                    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>the terms of any separate license agreement
                    you may have executed<br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>except as required for reasonable and customary
                    use in describing the<br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>agreed to in writing,
                    Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                    BASIS,<br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>implied, including,
                    without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
                    FITNESS FOR A<br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>appropriateness
                    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>whether in tort
                    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly<br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>liable
                    to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>incidental, or consequential
                    damages of any character arising as a<br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to
                    use the<br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>work stoppage,
                    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if
                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.
                    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole
                    responsibility, not on behalf<br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>defend,
                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                    <br/>Comment from<br/><a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Crack_prevention">iPhone Dev
                        Wiki<br/>Crack Prevention</a>: App Store binaries are signed by both their developer<br/>and
                    Apple. This encrypts the binary so that decryption keys are needed in order<br/>to make the binary
                    readable. When iOS executes the binary, the decryption keys<br/>are used to decrypt the binary into
                    a readable state where it is then loaded<br/>into memory and executed. iOS can tell the encryption
                    status of a binary via the<br/>cryptid structure member of LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO MachO load command. If
                    cryptid is<br/>a non-zero value then the binary is encrypted.
                    <br/>'Cracking' works by letting the kernel decrypt the binary then siphoning the<br/>decrypted data
                    into a new binary file, resigning, and repackaging. This will<br/>only work on jailbroken devices as
                    codesignature validation has been removed.<br/>Resigning takes place because while the codesignature
                    doesn't have to be valid<br/>thanks to the jailbreak, it does have to be in place unless you have
                    AppSync or<br/>similar to disable codesignature checks.

                    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable<br/>copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br/>publicly display,
                    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
                    Object form.
                    <br/>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>this License, each
                    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable<br/>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>use, offer
                    to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>where such license applies only to those
                    patent claims licensable<br/>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>Contribution(s)
                    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
                    submitted. If You<br/>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>cross-claim or
                    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
                    constitutes direct<br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>granted to
                    You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>Work or Derivative Works
                    thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
                    that You<br/>meet the following conditions:
                    <br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>Derivative Works a copy of this
                    License; and
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that You changed
                    the files; and
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>that You distribute, all
                    copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>excluding
                    those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>the Derivative Works; and
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained<br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>pertain to any part
                    of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                    distributed<br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>documentation, if
                    provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and<br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>of the NOTICE
                    file are for informational purposes only and<br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own
                    attribution<br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>or as an addendum
                    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be
                    construed<br/>as modifying the License.
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>may provide additional
                    or different license terms and conditions<br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or<br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>reproduction,
                    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>the conditions stated in this License.
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>any Contribution
                    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of<br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>Notwithstanding
                    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>the terms of any separate license agreement
                    you may have executed<br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>except as required for reasonable and customary
                    use in describing the<br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>agreed to in writing,
                    Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                    BASIS,<br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>implied, including,
                    without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
                    FITNESS FOR A<br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>appropriateness
                    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>whether in tort
                    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly<br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>liable
                    to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>incidental, or consequential
                    damages of any character arising as a<br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to
                    use the<br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>work stoppage,
                    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if
                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.
                    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole
                    responsibility, not on behalf<br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>defend,
                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                    <br/>Comment from<br/><a href="http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Crack_prevention">iPhone Dev
                        Wiki<br/>Crack Prevention</a>: App Store binaries are signed by both their developer<br/>and
                    Apple. This encrypts the binary so that decryption keys are needed in order<br/>to make the binary
                    readable. When iOS executes the binary, the decryption keys<br/>are used to decrypt the binary into
                    a readable state where it is then loaded<br/>into memory and executed. iOS can tell the encryption
                    status of a binary via the<br/>cryptid structure member of LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO MachO load command. If
                    cryptid is<br/>a non-zero value then the binary is encrypted.
                    <br/>'Cracking' works by letting the kernel decrypt the binary then siphoning the<br/>decrypted data
                    into a new binary file, resigning, and repackaging. This will<br/>only work on jailbroken devices as
                    codesignature validation has been removed.<br/>Resigning takes place because while the codesignature
                    doesn't have to be valid<br/>thanks to the jailbreak, it does have to be in place unless you have
                    AppSync or<br/>similar to disable codesignature checks.

                    <br/>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>this License, each
                    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable<br/>copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br/>publicly display,
                    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br/>Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
                    Object form.
                    <br/>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>this License, each
                    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
                    irrevocable<br/>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>use, offer
                    to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>where such license applies only to those
                    patent claims licensable<br/>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>Contribution(s)
                    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
                    submitted. If You<br/>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>cross-claim or
                    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
                    constitutes direct<br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>granted to
                    You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>Work or Derivative Works
                    thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
                    that You<br/>meet the following conditions:
                    <br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>Derivative Works a copy of this
                    License; and
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>stating that You changed
                    the files; and
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>that You distribute, all
                    copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>excluding
                    those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>the Derivative Works; and
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>distribution, then any
                    Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices
                    contained<br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>pertain to any part
                    of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                    distributed<br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>documentation, if
                    provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>within a display generated by the Derivative
                    Works, if and<br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>of the NOTICE
                    file are for informational purposes only and<br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own
                    attribution<br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>or as an addendum
                    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be
                    construed<br/>as modifying the License.
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>may provide additional
                    or different license terms and conditions<br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                    modifications, or<br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>reproduction,
                    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>the conditions stated in this License.
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>any Contribution
                    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the
                    terms and conditions of<br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>Notwithstanding
                    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>the terms of any separate license agreement
                    you may have executed<br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>names, trademarks,
                    service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>except as required for reasonable and customary
                    use in describing the<br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>agreed to in writing,
                    Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
                    BASIS,<br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>implied, including,
                    without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
                    FITNESS FOR A<br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>appropriateness
                    of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>risks associated with Your exercise of
                    permissions under this License.
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>whether in tort
                    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>unless required by applicable law (such as
                    deliberate and grossly<br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>liable
                    to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>incidental, or consequential
                    damages of any character arising as a<br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to
                    use the<br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>work stoppage,
                    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if
                    such Contributor<br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>the Work or Derivative
                    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
                    indemnity,<br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>License.
                    However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole
                    responsibility, not on behalf<br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>defend,
                    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against,
                    such Contributor by reason<br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
