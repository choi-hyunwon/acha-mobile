                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>

                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>

                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/><br/>
                    <br/>granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>

                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>

                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>
                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br/><br/>
                    <br/>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>

                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>

                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>

                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>

                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>

                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>

                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>

                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>

                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>

                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>

                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>

                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>

                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>

                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/><br/>
                    <br/>granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>

                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>

                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>
                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br/><br/>
                    <br/>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>

                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>

                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>

                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>
                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>

                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>

                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>

                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>

                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>

                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>

                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>

                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>

                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>

                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>

                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>
                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>

                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>

                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>

                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>

                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>

                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>

                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>

                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>

                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>

                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>

                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>

                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>

                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>

                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>

                    <br/>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/><br/>
                    <br/>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/><br/>
                    <br/>granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/><br/>
                    <br/>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/><br/>
                    <br/>meet the following conditions:<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/><br/>
                    <br/>stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/><br/>
                    <br/>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/><br/>
                    <br/>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/><br/>
                    <br/>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/><br/>
                    <br/>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/><br/>
                    <br/>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>as modifying the License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/><br/>
                    <br/>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/><br/>
                    <br/>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/><br/>
                    <br/>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/><br/>
                    <br/>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/><br/>
                    <br/>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/><br/>
                    <br/>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/><br/>
                    <br/>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/><br/>
                    <br/>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/><br/>
                    <br/>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/><br/>
                    <br/>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/><br/>
                    <br/>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/><br/>
                    <br/>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/><br/>
                    <br/>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/><br/>
                    <br/>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/><br/>
                    <br/>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/><br/>
                    <br/>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/><br/>
                    <br/>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/><br/>
                    <br/>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/><br/>
                    <br/>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/><br/>
                    <br/>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>
                    <br/>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>

                    <br/>Statement of Purpose
                    <br/>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright
                    and
                    <br/>Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an
                    "owner")
                    <br/>of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").<br/><br/><br/>Certain
                    owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing
                    <br/>to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can
                    reliably
                    <br/>and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
                    works,
                    <br/>reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
                    including
                    <br/>without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote
                    the
                    <br/>ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works,
                    or to
                    <br/>gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
                    <br/>others.<br/><br/><br/>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
                    expectation of additional
                    <br/>consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the
                    <br/>extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
                    elects to
                    <br/>apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his
                    or her
                    <br/>Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on
                    those
                    <br/>rights.<br/><br/><br/>1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
                    protected by copyright and
                    <br/>related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
                    <br/>include, but are not limited to, the following:<br/><br/><br/>the right to reproduce, adapt,
                    distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
                    <br/>moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
                    <br/>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
                    <br/>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations
                    in
                    <br/>paragraph 4(a), below;
                    <br/>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
                    <br/>database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and
                    of the
                    <br/>Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
                    implementation
                    <br/>thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
                    <br/>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law
                    or
                    <br/>treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
                    <br/>2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
                    <br/>Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
                    and
                    <br/>surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of
                    <br/>action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
                    <br/>action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided
                    by
                    <br/>applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
                    medium
                    <br/>and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
                    <br/>commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for
                    the
                    <br/>benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
                    <br/>successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission,
                    <br/>cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
                    enjoyment of
                    <br/>the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of
                    Purpose.<br/><br/><br/>3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
                    judged legally invalid
                    <br/>or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
                    <br/>permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
                    extent
                    <br/>the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
                    <br/>transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
                    exercise
                    <br/>Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for
                    the
                    <br/>maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
                    in
                    <br/>any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
                    <br/>including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").
                    The
                    <br/>License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
                    Should any
                    <br/>part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
                    law,
                    <br/>such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
                    and in
                    <br/>such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
                    remaining
                    <br/>Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
                    action
                    <br/>with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of
                    Purpose.<br/><br/><br/>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br/><br/><br/>No trademark or patent rights
                    held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or
                    <br/>otherwise affected by this document.

                    <br/>Terms and conditions
                    <br/>This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
                    <br/>1. Introduction
                    <br/>1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and
                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed
                    <br/>to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally
                    binding
                    <br/>contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the
                    <br/>Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project,
                    which
                    <br/>is located at the following URL: https://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time. 1.3
                    A
                    <br/>"compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android
                    <br/>Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the

                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
                    <br/>LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,

                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless

                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
                    infringes any
                    <br/>copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of

                    <br/>non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>1. Introduction
                    <br/>1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and
                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed
                    <br/>to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally
                    binding
                    <br/>contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the
                    <br/>Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project,
                    which
                    <br/>is located at the following URL: https://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time. 1.3
                    A
                    <br/>"compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android
                    <br/>Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website
                    <br/>(https://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to time; and (ii)

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

                    <br/>NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
                    <br/>LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,

                    BEEN
                    <br/>AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
                    <br/>Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and

                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that

                    <br/>non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,

                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept

                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
                    <br/>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
                    <br/>10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
                    THE
                    <br/>SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR
                    <br/>USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS
                    AT
                    <br/>YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER
                    SYSTEM
                    <br/>OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY
                    DISCLAIMS
                    <br/>ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO
                    <br/>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
                    <br/>NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
                    <br/>LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
                    <br/>INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING
                    ANY
                    <br/>LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE
                    BEEN
                    <br/>AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
                    <br/>Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
                    <br/>against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
                    infringes any
                    <br/>copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of
                    any
                    <br/>person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
                    <br/>non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by

                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of

                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed
                    <br/>to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally
                    binding
                    <br/>contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the
                    <br/>Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project,
                    which

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall

                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>1. Introduction
                    <br/>1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and
                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed
                    <br/>to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally
                    binding
                    <br/>contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the
                    <br/>Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project,
                    which
                    <br/>is located at the following URL: https://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time. 1.3
                    A
                    <br/>"compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

                    <br/>NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS

                    BEEN
                    <br/>AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless

                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that

                    <br/>non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and
                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the

                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the

                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not

                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
                    <br/>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
                    <br/>10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
                    THE
                    <br/>SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR
                    <br/>USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS
                    AT
                    <br/>YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER
                    SYSTEM
                    <br/>OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY
                    DISCLAIMS
                    <br/>ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO
                    <br/>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
                    <br/>NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
                    <br/>LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
                    <br/>INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING
                    ANY
                    <br/>LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE
                    BEEN
                    <br/>AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
                    <br/>Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
                    <br/>against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
                    infringes any
                    <br/>copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of
                    any
                    <br/>person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
                    <br/>non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve

                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed
                    <br/>to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally
                    binding
                    <br/>contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the
                    <br/>Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project,
                    which

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
                    <br/>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
                    <br/>10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
                    THE
                    <br/>SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR
                    <br/>USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS
                    AT
                    <br/>YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER
                    SYSTEM
                    <br/>OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY

                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that

                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>1. Introduction
                    <br/>1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and
                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed
                    <br/>to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally
                    binding
                    <br/>contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK. 1.2 "Android" means the
                    <br/>Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project,
                    which
                    <br/>is located at the following URL: https://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time. 1.3
                    A
                    <br/>"compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may

                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS

                    BEEN
                    <br/>AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless

                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of

                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that

                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>1. Introduction
                    <br/>1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and
                    <br/>specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is
                    licensed
                    <br/>to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally
                    binding

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
                    <br/>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
                    <br/>10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
                    THE
                    <br/>SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR
                    <br/>USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS
                    AT
                    <br/>YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER

                    DISCLAIMS
                    <br/>ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO
                    <br/>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
                    <br/>NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
                    <br/>LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
                    <br/>INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING
                    ANY
                    <br/>LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE
                    BEEN
                    <br/>AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
                    <br/>Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
                    <br/>against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
                    infringes any
                    <br/>copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of
                    any

                    <br/>non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"

                    <br/>2. Accepting this License Agreement
                    <br/>2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the
                    SDK
                    <br/>if you do not accept the License Agreement. 2.2 By clicking to accept and/or using this SDK,
                    you
                    <br/>hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement. 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
                    use the
                    <br/>SDK. 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
                    <br/>other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
                    employer or
                    <br/>such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not
                    accept
                    <br/>the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
                    <br/>3. SDK License from Google
                    <br/>3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
                    <br/>royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
                    solely to
                    <br/>develop applications for compatible implementations of Android. 3.2 You may not use this SDK to
                    <br/>develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android)
                    or to
                    <br/>develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms,
                    including
                    <br/>non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
                    3.3
                    <br/>You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the
                    SDK,
                    <br/>including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
                    Rights"
                    <br/>means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and
                    any
                    <br/>and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. 3.4
                    You
                    <br/>may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to
                    the
                    <br/>extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup
                    purposes),
                    <br/>modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative
                    works of
                    <br/>the SDK or any part of the SDK. 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
                    <br/>licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                    source
                    <br/>software license and not the License Agreement. 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the
                    SDK
                    <br/>that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK
                    may
                    <br/>be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
                    or
                    <br/>to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 3.7 Nothing in the
                    <br/>License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service
                    marks,
                    <br/>logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features. 3.8 You agree that you will not
                    remove,
                    <br/>obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices)
                    that
                    <br/>may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
                    <br/>4. Use of the SDK by You
                    <br/>4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
                    under the
                    <br/>License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including
                    any
                    <br/>intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications. 4.2 You agree to use the SDK
                    and
                    <br/>write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b)
                    any
                    <br/>applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
                    <br/>jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the
                    United
                    <br/>States or other relevant countries). 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop
                    applications
                    <br/>for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the
                    users
                    <br/>provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you
                    must
                    <br/>make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must
                    <br/>provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application
                    stores
                    <br/>personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
                    provides
                    <br/>your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that
                    information to
                    <br/>access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has
                    given
                    <br/>you permission to do so. 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
                    <br/>including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts,
                    <br/>damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or
                    <br/>services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications
                    <br/>carrier. 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                    responsibility to
                    <br/>you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
                    display
                    <br/>through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions
                    (including
                    <br/>any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so. 4.6 You agree that you are solely
                    <br/>responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any
                    breach
                    <br/>of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms
                    of
                    <br/>Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                    damage
                    <br/>which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
                    <br/>5. Your Developer Credentials
                    <br/>5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
                    <br/>credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you
                    will
                    <br/>be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
                    <br/>6. Privacy and Information
                    <br/>6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
                    <br/>statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
                    <br/>address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the
                    SDK
                    <br/>are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the
                    SDK
                    <br/>will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be
                    <br/>collected. 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is
                    maintained
                    <br/>in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://policies.google.com/privacy 6.3 Anonymized and aggregated sets of the data may be
                    shared
                    <br/>with Google partners to improve the SDK.
                    <br/>7. Third Party Applications
                    <br/>7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
                    content
                    <br/>or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those
                    <br/>applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources
                    which
                    <br/>you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person
                    from
                    <br/>which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
                    experience
                    <br/>as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources. 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through
                    such a
                    <br/>third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the
                    <br/>providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease,
                    loan,
                    <br/>sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either
                    in
                    <br/>whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
                    <br/>owners. 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
                    <br/>resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
                    case,
                    <br/>the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
                    <br/>8. Using Android APIs
                    <br/>8.1 Google Data APIs 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge
                    that the
                    <br/>data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those
                    parties
                    <br/>that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
                    API
                    <br/>may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell,
                    <br/>distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless
                    allowed
                    <br/>by the relevant Terms of Service. 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from
                    Google,
                    <br/>you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent
                    and
                    <br/>only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
                    If
                    <br/>you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time
                    to
                    <br/>time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for
                    <br/>Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL:
                    <br/>https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By
                    clicking
                    <br/>to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where
                    Google
                    <br/>is a Data Processor.
                    <br/>9. Terminating this License Agreement
                    <br/>9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
                    set out
                    <br/>below. 9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK and any relevant developer credentials. 9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License
                    <br/>Agreement with you if: (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or (B)
                    Google
                    <br/>is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK
                    (such
                    <br/>as APIs) to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to
                    users
                    <br/>in the country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of
                    the
                    <br/>SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
                    commercially
                    <br/>viable. 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations
                    and
                    <br/>liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
                    over
                    <br/>time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
                    <br/>indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall
                    <br/>continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
                    <br/>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
                    <br/>10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
                    THE
                    <br/>SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM GOOGLE. 10.2 YOUR
                    <br/>USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS
                    AT

                    SYSTEM
                    <br/>OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE. 10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY
                    DISCLAIMS
                    <br/>ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO

                    <br/>NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                    <br/>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
                    <br/>11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
                    <br/>LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,

                    ANY
                    <br/>LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE
                    BEEN
                    <br/>AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                    <br/>12. Indemnification
                    <br/>12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
                    <br/>Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
                    <br/>against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses,
                    <br/>liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
                    or
                    <br/>accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
                    infringes any
                    <br/>copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of
                    any
                    <br/>person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
                    <br/>non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
                    <br/>13. Changes to the License Agreement
                    <br/>13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
                    SDK.
                    <br/>When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement available
                    on
                    <br/>the website where the SDK is made available.
                    <br/>14. General Legal Terms
                    <br/>14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                    governs
                    <br/>your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate
                    written
                    <br/>agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to
                    the
                    <br/>SDK. 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                    is
                    <br/>contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable
                    law),
                    <br/>this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or
                    remedies
                    <br/>will still be available to Google. 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide
                    on
                    <br/>this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision
                    will
                    <br/>be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The
                    <br/>remaining provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable. 14.4
                    You
                    <br/>acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent
                    shall
                    <br/>be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies shall be
                    <br/>entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License Agreement that
                    confers a
                    <br/>benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be
                    third
                    <br/>party beneficiaries to the License Agreement. 14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO
                    UNITED
                    <br/>STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT
                    LAWS
                    <br/>AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END
                    USERS
                    <br/>AND END USE. 14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or
                    transferred by
                    <br/>either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                    Google
                    <br/>shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
                    Agreement
                    <br/>without the prior written approval of the other party. 14.7 The License Agreement, and your
                    <br/>relationship with Google under the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the
                    State of
                    <br/>California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to
                    the
                    <br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to
                    resolve
                    <br/>any legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
                    Google
                    <br/>shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
                    <br/>relief) in any jurisdiction. July 27, 2021"
